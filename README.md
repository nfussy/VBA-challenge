# VBA-challenge

###Background
I followed the instructions listed on Canvas in order to complete this assignment. On top of this, I was rather confused by the criteria of uploading "Screenshots of the results", so I opted to upload the results that I achieved for all 4 Quarters, labeled "Q1" through "Q4", respectively.

Collaboration with others:
None for this assignment; other than asking questions, or reading answers for other student's questions, in Slack.

> I used this answer on StackOverflow when it came to the formatting of Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Volume. The code was edited to fit with my variables and with the positioning of the answers.

> My original document operated without any issues while Dim-ing i as an "Integer"; however, this needed to be changed from "Integer" to "Long" on the true assignment, as Micah reminded us that Integers have a maximum that is capped at 32,767, which is grossly exceeded by the 93,001 lines of the final assignment

> Conversation I had with Yara El-Emam about the the conditional formatting that would be needed in the assignment. "Would we be able to use an iteration of the same code from the 'grader.xlsm' file from class?"

**All other lines of code were generated from what we learned in class**
